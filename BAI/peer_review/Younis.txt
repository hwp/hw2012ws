Title of the paper: Path Planning using Neural Networks
Author of the paper: Sohaib Younis

A. Summary of the paper:
This paper reviewed two advanced methods for path planning. The author talks about the importance of study on this topic, the related approaches. Then the two methods are introduced. 


B. Strengths of the paper:
Introduction and related work sections are written clearly. Logic of the structure in this paper is reasonable.


C. Weaknesses of the paper:
Should be more comprehensive when introducing the two methods. More specific information will be better for reader to catch the idea. 
Comparison between the methods is missing. 


D. Short evaluations

D1. Coverage of the topic:
Covered most related background information.

D2. Depth of the topic:
Details of algorithms are given.

D3. Structure:
Clear. First states the problem of previous approaches, then concludes what improvements those new methods achieves.

D4. Quality of presentation / comprehensibility:
Most part are comprehensive except the introduction of two algorithms. More details would be better.

D5. Linguistic quality:
Good. Easy to understand.

D6. Critical elaboration of the topic:
I expect more critical elaboration in the conclusion.


E. detailed comments to the author:
In section 2, second paragraph of page 3, "In cell decomposition approach, the **free** consists of a collection of cells and a particular sequence represent solution path.", I don't quite understand what does the word "free" mean. Is it misspelled?

In section 3.1 where there is a figure, I suggest you use float structure to contain the figure.
use \begin{figure}[placement specifier] ... figure contents ... \end{figure} % please refer to the sample tex file.

For the bibliography, there are some items which are not complete (year of publication is missing).
